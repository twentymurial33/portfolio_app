          Back in 2018, I decided to disrupt my life and dive into learning
          programming. I enrolled to a coding bootcamp and there my journey
          started themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding
          and web development. Fast-forward to today, and had the privilege of
          building software for an advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led
          design studio, and a huge corporation. When Im not at the computer, Im
          usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or
          running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds
